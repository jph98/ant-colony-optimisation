=======================

Ant Colony Optimisation Project, see - https://practicingruby.com/articles/ant-colony-simulation

* Ants wander randomly
* When find food then return to colony laying down pheromone trails
* If other Ants find path they follow it to the food, return, strengthen trail (positive feedback)
* Pheromone trails eventually evaporate

Emergence, self-organisation
